Revision 1.0



1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

There is a lack of translation for technical terminologies in the World Wide Web. Not all the technical terms in English are being translated to different languages. Some languages do not even have the translation for these technical terms. Therefore, the goal of Terminology Creation is to provide a web interface translator for uncommon technical terminologies. Users will also be able to input their own translation of technical terms in the languages that they are fluent in. In addition, users can provide the back translation of the foreign terms to English. This web service will be interactive for both developers and users. 

1.2 Design Map

The algorithm will be implemented in Python. It will pull the open source translation files for all and parse it using Python’s libraries for .po files, polib. 
This project will use the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) algorithm to calculate the probability of a pair being the translation of each other in a set of sentences. The probability then will be ordered from the highest value to lowest value. The cut off PMI for a pair will be [insert a value].
A database for all the possible pairings will be created using SQL and PHP. This data will interact with the web user interface and retrieve the translation that correspond to the terms.

1.3 Definitions

Back translation – a procedure in which a translator or team of translators interpreted a previously translated document from one language back to its original language.
Collocations – an expression of two or more words that often go together
Pointwise Mutual Information – theory that measure the relationship and probability between two words and information that can be gained from them. Approach to find collocations in the sentences.


2. Product Description

2.1 User characteristics
The potential users of our system are software developers and administrators.
Software developers can use the website to find translations of technical terminology to aid in the creation of software for a multitude of countries. They will also be able to change an incorrect translations and add back translations.
The administrators will manage the system to ensure the validity of the translations.

2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
It is assumed the user will have access to an Internet connection and a web browser. 
It is also assumed that those with accounts will contribute accurate information.

2.3 Constraints
The user has a constraint in that only users with an account will be allowed to change the translations or add to them. 
The accuracy of the algorithm is also a constraint. The accuracy of the translations is directly tied to the accuracy of the algorithm because the project depends on the algorithm to correctly create translations.


3. Requirements

3.1 Functional Requirements
Algorithm: 
The Pointwise Mutual Information algorithm is expected to run in O(n2) on each .PO files of the English sentences and the translated sentences. 
It will parse the given .PO files and check for the probability of a pair. The top probability values will be selected to create a database of the terminologies for different languages

Database:
The terminology database will store over 1000+ words across 200 languages. There will be databases for users’ registered information and hash table of users’ passwords. This information will be private to the public, only accessible to the developers. 

Web User Interface:
There will be a sign-up/sign-in screen that allows user to create an account. This will keep track of legitimate users, preventing spam and inappropriate back translation. 
The web user interface has an option of choosing the embedded languages in “Translate from” and “Translated to” menu. In addition, there will be a text box where the user can input the terms to be translated. 
Once the user finish inputting the data, there will be a “Translate” button, which will execute the algorithm that interact with the database and find the translation of the inserted terms. 
The back end of the user interface will generate a hash function for user’s passwords, this will create a layer of security for the users.
There will also be a public database that the users can insert their own back-translation of the undocumented terminologies. 

3.3 Usability
In order to use the web interface, users must have a basic knowledge of internet browser usage. Users should also be fluent in English, particularly if they are correcting translations.

3.4 Security
Login information should be encrypted. 
Accounts are password protected, so the user can verify his or her identity upon login.

3.5 Data
The project requires an open source library of .PO files.

4. User Scenarios
Scenario: Looking up a translation
  A user will type in the English word and select the language to which they want the term translated. If the translation exists in the database, the user will be able to see the translated term
Scenario: Editing translations
  Given the user is logged in, the user can edit an existing translation or add a new one to the database.
Scenario: Creating a new account
  The user will provide a valid email address and password in order to create a new account.
